<p>1. Replace a regular incandescent light bulb with a compact fluorescent light bulb<br />(cfl)<br />CFLs use 60% less energy than a regular bulb. This simple switch will save about 300<br />pounds of carbon dioxide a year.<br />2. Install a programmable thermostat<br />Programmable thermostats will automatically lower the heat or air conditioning at<br />night and raise them again in the morning. They can save you $100 a year on your<br />energy bill.<br />3. Move your thermostat down 2&deg; in winter and up 2&deg; in summer<br />Almost half of the energy we use in our homes goes to heating and cooling. You<br />could save about 2,000 pounds of carbon dioxide a year with this simple<br />adjustment.<br />4. Clean or replace filters on your furnace and air conditioner<br />Cleaning a dirty air filter can save 350 pounds of carbon dioxide a year.<br />5. Choose energy efficient appliances when making new purchases<br />Look for the Energy Star label on new appliances to choose the most energy<br />efficient products available.<br />6. Do not leave appliances on standby<br />Use the "on/off" function on the machine itself. A TV set that's switched on for 3<br />hours a day (the average time Europeans spend watching TV) and in standby<br />mode during the remaining 21 hours uses about 40% of its energy in standby mode.<br />7. Wrap your water heater in an insulation blanket<br />You&rsquo;ll save 1,000 pounds of carbon dioxide a year with this simple action. You can<br />save another 550 pounds per year by setting the thermostat no higher than 50&deg;C.<br />8. Move your fridge and freezer<br />Placing them next to the cooker or boiler consumes much more energy than if they<br />were standing on their own. For example, if you put them in a hot cellar room<br />where the room temperature is 30-35&ordm;C, energy use is almost double and causes an<br />extra 160kg of CO2 emissions for fridges per year and 320kg for freezers.<br />9. Defrost old fridges and freezers regularly<br />Even better is to replace them with newer models, which all have automatic<br />defrost cycles and are generally up to two times more energy-efficient than their<br />predecessors.<br />10. Don't let heat escape from your house over a long period<br />When airing your house, open the windows for only a few minutes. If you leave a<br />small opening all day long, the energy needed to keep it warm inside during six<br />cold months (10&ordm;C or less outside temperature) would result in almost 1 ton of CO2<br />emissions.<br />11. Replace your old single-glazed windows with double-glazing<br />This requires a bit of upfront investment, but will halve the energy lost through<br />windows and pay off in the long term. If you go for the best the market has to offer <br />Top 50 Things To Do To Stop Global Warming<br />You can find more at: http://globalwarming-facts.info/ 3<br />(wooden-framed double-glazed units with low-emission glass and filled with argon<br />gas), you can even save more than 70% of the energy lost.<br />12. Get a home energy audit<br />Many utilities offer free home energy audits to find where your home is poorly<br />insulated or energy inefficient. You can save up to 30% off your energy bill and<br />1,000 pounds of carbon dioxide a year. Energy Star can help you find an energy<br />specialist.<br />13. Cover your pots while cooking<br />Doing so can save a lot of the energy needed for preparing the dish. Even better<br />are pressure cookers and steamers: they can save around 70%!<br />14. Use the washing machine or dishwasher only when they are full<br />If you need to use it when it is half full, then use the half-load or economy setting.<br />There is also no need to set the temperatures high. Nowadays detergents are so<br />efficient that they get your clothes and dishes clean at low temperatures.<br />15. Take a shower instead of a bath<br />A shower takes up to four times less energy than a bath. To maximise the energy<br />saving, avoid power showers and use low-flow showerheads, which are cheap and<br />provide the same comfort.<br />16. Use less hot water<br />It takes a lot of energy to heat water. You can use less hot water by installing a low<br />flow showerhead (350 pounds of carbon dioxide saved per year) and washing your<br />clothes in cold or warm water (500 pounds saved per year) instead of hot.<br />17. Use a clothesline instead of a dryer whenever possible<br />You can save 700 pounds of carbon dioxide when you air dry your clothes for 6<br />months out of the year.<br />18. Insulate and weatherize your home<br />Properly insulating your walls and ceilings can save 25% of your home heating bill<br />and 2,000 pounds of carbon dioxide a year. Caulking and weather-stripping can<br />save another 1,700 pounds per year. Energy Efficient has more information on how<br />to better insulate your home.<br />19. Be sure you&rsquo;re recycling at home<br />You can save 2,400 pounds of carbon dioxide a year by recycling half of the waste<br />your household generates.<br />20. Recycle your organic waste<br />Around 3% of the greenhouse gas emissions through the methane is released by<br />decomposing bio-degradable waste. By recycling organic waste or composting it if<br />you have a garden, you can help eliminate this problem! Just make sure that you<br />compost it properly, so it decomposes with sufficient oxygen, otherwise your<br />compost will cause methane emissions and smell foul.<br />21. Buy intelligently<br />One bottle of 1.5l requires less energy and produces less waste than three bottles of <br />Top 50 Things To Do To Stop Global Warming<br />You can find more at: http://globalwarming-facts.info/ 4<br />0.5l. As well, buy recycled paper products: it takes less 70 to 90% less energy to<br />make recycled paper and it prevents the loss of forests worldwide.<br />22. Choose products that come with little packaging and buy refills when you can<br />You will also cut down on waste production and energy use... another help against<br />global warming.<br />23. Reuse your shopping bag<br />When shopping, it saves energy and waste to use a reusable bag instead of<br />accepting a disposable one in each shop. Waste not only discharges CO2 and<br />methane into the atmosphere, it can also pollute the air, groundwater and soil.<br />24. Reduce waste<br />Most products we buy cause greenhouse gas emissions in one or another way, e.g.<br />during production and distribution. By taking your lunch in a reusable lunch box<br />instead of a disposable one, you save the energy needed to produce new lunch<br />boxes.<br />25. Plant a tree<br />A single tree will absorb one ton of carbon dioxide over its lifetime. Shade provided<br />by trees can also reduce your air conditioning bill by 10 to 15%. The Arbor Day<br />Foundation has information on planting and provides trees you can plant with<br />membership.<br />26. Switch to green power<br />In many areas, you can switch to energy generated by clean, renewable sources<br />such as wind and solar. In some of these, you can even get refunds by government<br />if you choose to switch to a clean energy producer, and you can also earn money<br />by selling the energy you produce and don't use for yourself.<br />27. Buy locally grown and produced foods<br />The average meal in the United States travels 1,200 miles from the farm to your<br />plate. Buying locally will save fuel and keep money in your community.<br />28. Buy fresh foods instead of frozen<br />Frozen food uses 10 times more energy to produce.<br />29. Seek out and support local farmers markets<br />They reduce the amount of energy required to grow and transport the food to you<br />by one fifth. Seek farmer&rsquo;s markets in your area, and go for them.<br />30. Buy organic foods as much as possible<br />Organic soils capture and store carbon dioxide at much higher levels than soils<br />from conventional farms. If we grew all of our corn and soybeans organically, we&rsquo;d<br />remove 580 billion pounds of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere!<br />31. Eat less meat<br />Methane is the second most significant greenhouse gas and cows are one of the<br />greatest methane emitters. Their grassy diet and multiple stomachs cause them to<br />produce methane, which they exhale with every breath. <br />Top 50 Things To Do To Stop Global Warming<br />You can find more at: http://globalwarming-facts.info/ 5<br />32. Reduce the number of miles you drive by walking, biking, carpooling or taking<br />mass transit wherever possible<br />Avoiding just 10 miles of driving every week would eliminate about 500 pounds of<br />carbon dioxide emissions a year! Look for transit options in your area.<br />33. Start a carpool with your coworkers or classmates<br />Sharing a ride with someone just 2 days a week will reduce your carbon dioxide<br />emissions by 1,590 pounds a year. eRideShare.com runs a free service connecting<br />north american commuters and travelers.<br />34. Don't leave an empty roof rack on your car<br />This can increase fuel consumption and CO2 emissions by up to 10% due to wind<br />resistance and the extra weight - removing it is a better idea.<br />35. Keep your car tuned up<br />Regular maintenance helps improve fuel efficiency and reduces emissions. When<br />just 1% of car owners properly maintain their cars, nearly a billion pounds of carbon<br />dioxide are kept out of the atmosphere.<br />36. Drive carefully and do not waste fuel<br />You can reduce CO2 emissions by readjusting your driving style. Choose proper<br />gears, do not abuse the gas pedal, use the engine brake instead of the pedal<br />brake when possible and turn off your engine when your vehicle is motionless for<br />more than one minute. By readjusting your driving style you can save money on<br />both fuel and car mantainance.<br />37. Check your tires weekly to make sure they&rsquo;re properly inflated<br />Proper tire inflation can improve gas mileage by more than 3%. Since every gallon<br />of gasoline saved keeps 20 pounds of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, every<br />increase in fuel efficiency makes a difference!<br />38. When it is time for a new car, choose a more fuel efficient vehicle<br />You can save 3,000 pounds of carbon dioxide every year if your new car gets only 3<br />miles per gallon more than your current one. You can get up to 60 miles per gallon<br />with a hybrid! You can find information on fuel efficiency on FuelEconomy and on<br />GreenCars websites.<br />39. Try car sharing<br />Need a car but don&rsquo;t want to buy one? Community car sharing organizations<br />provide access to a car and your membership fee covers gas, maintenance and<br />insurance. Many companies &ndash; such as Flexcar - offer low emission or hybrid cars too!<br />Also, see ZipCar.<br />40. Try telecommuting from home<br />Telecommuting can help you drastically reduce the number of miles you drive<br />every week. For more information, check out the Telework Coalition.<br />41. Fly less<br />Air travel produces large amounts of emissions so reducing how much you fly by<br />even one or two trips a year can reduce your emissions significantly. You can also<br />offset your air travel carbon emissions by investingin renewable energy projects. <br />Top 50 Things To Do To Stop Global Warming<br />You can find more at: http://globalwarming-facts.info/ 6<br />42. Encourage your school or business to reduce emissions<br />You can extend your positive influence on global warming well beyond your home<br />by actively encouraging other to take action.<br />43. Join the virtual march<br />The Stop Global Warming Virtual March is a non-political effort to bring people<br />concerned about global warming together in one place. Add your voice to the<br />hundreds of thousands of other people urging action on this issue.<br />44. Encourage the switch to renewable energy<br />Successfully combating global warming requires a national transition to renewable<br />energy sources such as solar, wind and biomass. These technologies are ready to<br />be deployed more widely but there are regulatory barriers impeding them. U.S.<br />citizens, take action to break down those barriers with Vote Solar.<br />45. Protect and conserve forest worldwide<br />Forests play a critial role in global warming: they store carbon. When forests are<br />burned or cut down, their stored carbon is release into the atmosphere -<br />deforestation now accounts for about 20% of carbon dioxide emissions each year.<br />Conservation International has more information on saving forests from global<br />warming.<br />46. Consider the impact of your investments<br />If you invest your money, you should consider the impact that your investments and<br />savings will have on global warming. Check out SocialInvest and Ceres to can learn<br />more about how to ensure your money is being invested in companies, products<br />and projects that address issues related to climate change.<br />47. Make your city cool<br />Cities and states around the country have taken action to stop global warming by<br />passing innovative transportation and energy saving legislation. If you're in the U.S.,<br />join the cool cities list.<br />48. Tell Congress to act<br />The McCain Lieberman Climate Stewardship and Innovation Act would set a firm<br />limit on carbon dioxide emissions and then use free market incentives to lower<br />costs, promote efficiency and spur innovation. Tell your representative to support it.<br />49. Make sure your voice is heard!<br />Americans must have a stronger commitment from their government in order to<br />stop global warming and implement solutions and such a commitment won&rsquo;t come<br />without a dramatic increase in citizen lobbying for new laws with teeth. Get the<br />facts about U.S. politicians and candidates at Project Vote Smart and The League<br />of Conservation Voters. Make sure your voice is heard by voting!<br />50.
