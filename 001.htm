<h2>Physical Activity</h2>
<ul>
<li>Only one in three children are physically active every day.<sup><a id="_ftnref1" href="https://www.hhs.gov/fitness/resource-center/facts-and-statistics/index.html#footnote-1">1</a></sup></li>
<li>Less than 5% of adults participate in 30 minutes of physical activity each day;<sup><a id="_ftnref2" href="https://www.hhs.gov/fitness/resource-center/facts-and-statistics/index.html#footnote-2">2</a></sup>&nbsp;only one in three adults receive the recommended amount of physical activity each week.<sup><a id="_ftnref3" href="https://www.hhs.gov/fitness/resource-center/facts-and-statistics/index.html#footnote-3">3</a></sup></li>
<li>Only 35 &ndash; 44% of adults 75 years or older are physically active, and 28-34% of adults ages 65-74 are physically active.<sup><a id="_ftnref4" href="https://www.hhs.gov/fitness/resource-center/facts-and-statistics/index.html#footnote-4">4</a></sup></li>
<li>More than 80% of adults do not meet the guidelines for both aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities, and more than 80% of adolescents do not do enough aerobic physical activity to meet the guidelines for youth.<sup><a id="_ftnref5" href="https://www.hhs.gov/fitness/resource-center/facts-and-statistics/index.html#footnote-5">5</a></sup></li>
<li>In 2013, research found adults in the following states to be most likely to report exercising 3 or more days a week for at least 30 minutes: Vermont (65.3%), Hawaii (62.2%), Montana (60.1%), Alaska (60.1%). The least likely were Delaware (46.5%), West Virginia (47.1%) and Alabama (47.5%). The national average for regular exercise is 51.6%.<sup><a id="_ftnref6" href="https://www.hhs.gov/fitness/resource-center/facts-and-statistics/index.html#footnote-6">6</a></sup></li>
<li>Children now spend more than seven and a half hours a day in front of a screen (e.g., TV, videogames, computer).<sup><a id="_ftnref7" href="https://www.hhs.gov/fitness/resource-center/facts-and-statistics/index.html#footnote-7">7</a></sup></li>
<li>Nationwide, 25.6% of persons with a disability reported being physically inactive during a usual week, compared to 12.8% of those without a disability.<sup><a id="_ftnref3" href="https://www.hhs.gov/fitness/resource-center/facts-and-statistics/index.html#footnote-3">3</a></sup></li>
<li>Only about one in five homes have parks within a half-mile, and about the same number have a fitness or recreation center within that distance.<sup><a id="_ftnref5" href="https://www.hhs.gov/fitness/resource-center/facts-and-statistics/index.html#footnote-5">5</a></sup></li>
<li>Only 6 states (Illinois, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New York and Vermont) require physical education in every grade, K-12.<sup><a id="_ftnref22" href="https://www.hhs.gov/fitness/resource-center/facts-and-statistics/index.html#footnote-22">22</a></sup></li>
<li>28.0% of Americans, or 80.2 million people, aged six and older are physically inactive.<sup><a id="_ftnref23" href="https://www.hhs.gov/fitness/resource-center/facts-and-statistics/index.html#footnote-23">23</a></sup></li>
<li>Nearly one-third of high school students play video or computer games for 3 or more hours on an average school day.<sup><a id="_ftnref24" href="https://www.hhs.gov/fitness/resource-center/facts-and-statistics/index.html#footnote-24">24</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<h2>Nutrition</h2>
<ul>
<li>Typical American diets exceed the recommended intake levels or limits in four categories: calories from solid fats and added sugars; refined grains; sodium; and saturated fat.<sup><a id="_ftnref2" href="https://www.hhs.gov/fitness/resource-center/facts-and-statistics/index.html#footnote-2">2</a></sup></li>
<li>Americans eat less than the recommended amounts of vegetables, fruits, whole-grains, dairy products, and oils.<sup><a id="_ftnref2" href="https://www.hhs.gov/fitness/resource-center/facts-and-statistics/index.html#footnote-2">2</a></sup></li>
<li>About 90% of Americans eat more sodium than is recommended for a healthy diet.<sup><a id="_ftnref8" href="https://www.hhs.gov/fitness/resource-center/facts-and-statistics/index.html#footnote-8">8</a></sup></li>
<li>Reducing the sodium Americans eat by 1,200mg per day on could save up to $20 billion a year in medical costs.<sup><a id="_ftnref8" href="https://www.hhs.gov/fitness/resource-center/facts-and-statistics/index.html#footnote-8">8</a></sup></li>
<li>Food available for consumption increased in all major food categories from 1970 to 2008. Average daily calories per person in the marketplace increased approximately 600 calories.<sup><a id="_ftnref2" href="https://www.hhs.gov/fitness/resource-center/facts-and-statistics/index.html#footnote-2">2</a></sup></li>
<li>Since the 1970s, the number of fast food restaurants has more than doubled.<sup><a id="_ftnref2" href="https://www.hhs.gov/fitness/resource-center/facts-and-statistics/index.html#footnote-2">2</a></sup></li>
<li>More than 23 million Americans, including 6.5 million children, live in food deserts &ndash; areas that are more than a mile away from a supermarket.<sup><a id="_ftnref9" href="https://www.hhs.gov/fitness/resource-center/facts-and-statistics/index.html#footnote-9">9</a></sup></li>
<li>In 2008, an estimated 49.1 million people, including 16.7 million children, experienced food insecurity (limited availability to safe and nutritionally adequate foods) multiple times throughout the year.<sup><a id="_ftnref10" href="https://www.hhs.gov/fitness/resource-center/facts-and-statistics/index.html#footnote-10">10</a></sup></li>
<li>In 2013, residents of the following states were most likely to report eating at least five servings of vegetables four or more days per week: Vermont (68.7%), Montana (63.0%) and Washington (61.8%). The least likely were Oklahoma (52.3%), Louisiana (53.3%) and Missouri (53.8%). The national average for regular produce consumption is 57.7%.</li>
<li>Empty calories from added sugars and solid fats contribute to 40% of total daily calories for 2&ndash;18 year olds and half of these empty calories come from six sources: soda, fruit drinks, dairy desserts, grain desserts, pizza, and whole milk.</li>
<li>US adults consume an average of 3,400 mg/day [of sodium], well above the current federal guideline of less than 2,300 mg daily.</li>
<li>Food safety awareness goes hand-in-hand with nutrition education. In the United States, food-borne agents affect 1 out of 6 individuals and cause approximately 48 million illnesses, 128,000 hospitalizations, and 3,000 deaths each year.</li>
<li>US per capita consumption of total fat increased from approximately 57 pounds in 1980 to 78 pounds in 2009 with the highest consumption being 85 pounds in 2005.</li>
<li>The US percentage of food-insecure households, those with limited or uncertain ability to acquire acceptable foods in socially acceptable ways, rose from 11% to 15% between 2005 and 2009.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Obesity</h2>
<ul>
<li>Data from 2009-2010 indicates that over 78 million U.S. adults and about 12.5 million (16.9%) children and adolescents are obese.</li>
<li>Recent reports project that by 2030, half of all adults (115 million adults) in the United States will be obese.</li>
<li>Overweight adolescents have a 70% chance of becoming overweight or obese adults.</li>
<li>For children with disabilities, obesity rates are approximately 38% higher than for children without disabilities. It gets worse for the adult population where obesity rates for adults with disabilities are approximately 57% higher than for adults without disabilities.</li>

<li>Obesity among children in the United States has remained flat - at around 17% - in 2003-2004 and 2011-2012.</li>
<li>Between 2003 and 2012, obesity among children between 2 and 5 years of age has declined from 14% to 8% - a 43% decrease in just under a decade.</li>
<li>Obesity rates in children 6 to 11 years old have decreased from 18.8% in 2003-2004 to 17.7% in 2011-2012; obesity rates for children 12 to 19 years old have increased from 17.4% to 20.5% in the same time period.</li>
