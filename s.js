I want to tell you a little bit about myself

this website is a personal little website that I made at school and at home I actually have ADHD learning disabilities and unspecified trauma disorder and anxiety. I used to be interested in electronics I still am but not as much anymore I love coding,the internet,computers,and really any kind of tech.I have to take 9 pills in the morning,a half a pill at lunch time,and 5 and a half pills at dinner I have to have two baby monitors because of my anxiety
